Utterance,Type
Yes^ I can,Conversation
hey what's going on,Conversation
don't get how are you,Conversation
How,Conversation
Are you doing in this class so far,Conversation
um well considering I put like 80% of my grade into the project^ I feel like i'm doing great,Conversation
it's all like completion and attending class so,Conversation
Okay^ I should be,Conversation
yeah I spread it out a little bit^ so I put like 40% of the grade into the final project because I don't know how much of it^ be able to pull off,Conversation
exactly like,Conversation
So this is kind of what we're building datsun squares,Conversation
So I think we can get everything done^ but the new learning part we'll see how that goes^ you have to find a proper data Center train this thing on,Conversation
yeah well^ I mean hopefully this does something right^ I mean this is supposed to be dagger for y'all to,Conversation
yeah yeah correct correct awesome okay so,Conversation
yeah alright^ so this is a game of dots and boxes so,Instruction
So he re's kind of what you see so here are the roles what we're going to do so^ the goal is to capture an entire box and the way you capture an entire box is to fill in the rectangle around that right you play against a single opponent^ at least^ it will be me and you,Instruction
Okay^ be careful that you don't create a situation where the other person can capture an entire box right,Strategy
here's the thing,Conversation
After you capture a box you get to go again so your turn does not end whenever you capture a box,Instruction
seems like,Conversation
it's a cyclical situation where you just keep capturing boxes over and over again right okay okay,Strategy
and whoever has the most boxes^ at the end essentially wins,Instruction
Okay seems simple enough,Conversation
awesome awesome let's make sure that,Conversation
Share okay alright so we're gonna play this game^ on this particular little website,Conversation
Solomon if you're watching this instead of using your drawings Well^ this is much more interactive for us and much easier to set up rather than draw things^ so this is where we'll do it okay so let's play the game,Conversation
he'll be with other people to five by four is a pretty decent grid,Conversation
or right yes it's a private game alright so i'm going to go and share this thing with you on chat,Conversation
awesome,Conversation
There you go if you will please join the game,Conversation
horse,Conversation
There we go i'm ready,Conversation
to play by five rounds let's see if you can get up to speed within,Conversation
five rounds okay,Conversation
Okay i'll try my best,Conversation
Okay^ so my turn I will connect here,Conversation
Okay,Conversation
There we go,Conversation
wow,Conversation
Ah,Conversation
yeah that's exactly how it works,Conversation
Okay^ so,Conversation
Since I connected I get to go again,Instruction
You think this is simple^ but this thing has like a ton of strategy behind it,Conversation
yeah I wonder what do you understand was when this particular game was invented,Conversation
I don't know exactly when this thing was,Conversation
Interesting yeah yeah yeah It is interesting^ like again it's so simple to play^ but I went up against the computer a few times and man it just rolled me every single time,Conversation
I think I think I want one game yeah,Conversation
wow,Conversation
I wonder what type of what type of Ai they use for their,Conversation
system so,Conversation
dominating it's it's it's gotta be a Min Max,Conversation
yeah it's got to be a simple a simple decision trees can get this done because computers very efficient at forcing you into back moves,Conversation
And to do it is I would assume it would be very fast so,Conversation
It makes sense,Conversation
We go,Conversation
Forward starting to get filled,Conversation
getting close at some point we have to make a,Conversation
Yes,Conversation
yeah,Conversation
There we go,Conversation
interesting,Conversation
it's like the how good you are is all about these patterns that you create,Strategy
And then you force your audience to have to connect,Strategy
To make these moves to to connect yeah,Strategy
um yeah okay,Conversation
that's one let's see,Conversation
let's see what's a good thing yeah,Conversation
There we go,Conversation
Thank,Conversation
You wanna you want to try to minimize,Strategy
The damage you minimize what they can do,Strategy
minimize what they can do yeah,Strategy
Exactly so that's probably a pretty good so that's,Conversation
Okay,Conversation
You missed this one^ I think,Conversation
Oh dang,Conversation
Oh wow the rest of them okay so,Conversation
pretty much create a almost yeah so you'll have to figure out which ones to smaller on this,Conversation
Okay^ so this is where they change,Conversation
Right^ and I think i'll probably have to give you the rest^ I don't have any other way out yeah,Conversation
let's see you^ but you did miss one,Conversation
Oh^ I missed one,Conversation
yeah,Conversation
yeah,Conversation
give you that last one^ though okay,Conversation
No^ you have to start you understand oh wait Oh^ it was me okay,Conversation
yeah sweet,Conversation
What you have to go,Conversation
So 1010 it's a draw,Conversation
hey whoo,Conversation
yeah let's do it okay,Conversation
This is coming through out here,Conversation
Is the hell,Conversation
Okay let's see my turn all right let's go,Conversation
Okay,Conversation
not going to give you a free box^ this time,Conversation
So^ have you been at you empty your whole college lifetime,Conversation
yeah pretty much pretty much yeah,Conversation
I actually started the master's program back in 2007 but due to personal reasons I just never able to finish it,Conversation
Okay^ oh you're in the master's program currently,Conversation
yeah okay,Conversation
cool,Conversation
it's my final class actually,Conversation
Oh well^ congratulations that's awesome,Conversation
graduating yeah yeah mommy,Conversation
awesome Thank you,Conversation
How did you like the the course as a whole,Conversation
or,Conversation
The degree plan,Conversation
I was a little bit all over the place^ I like I didn't focus on it's like jack of all trades master of none right like instead of going all oh no no,Conversation
it's click there's nothing okay,Conversation
Your turn again,Conversation
cool,Conversation
um So if you started it so long ago,Conversation
Is your master's program like,Conversation
Specifically^ or is it more general because I know the masters and Ai is very recent,Conversation
Oh yes^ it just there's no,Conversation
09:3 9there's no specialization like I said I took a little bit of a island with cybersecurity a little bit of,Conversation
So I believe that way^ the degree plan work is you got to take some core classes from each group^ you know those groups that they have,Conversation
And then you can take whatever you want^ but these days^ I think I don't know if you agree^ or not^ maybe better to just focus^ you know really focus in on okay hang up^ let me,Conversation
Concentrate on yeah I don't know where to move here i'm not seeing a move^ without giving you a,Conversation
box okay and do that,Conversation
Oh no way that will give you the whole thing,Conversation
Okay^ I guess i'll just have to give you that,Conversation
Okay okay,Conversation
not bad^ I think the one I saw was this,Conversation
doesn't give you yeah yeah,Conversation
That doesn't give me,Conversation
so bad move on my part okay now i'm gonna have to all right^ I think,Conversation
I think this is the smallest one yeah,Conversation
I think these days it's better to just,Conversation
Give,Conversation
To get a masters in a more stuff wise feel I don't know like I said,Conversation
Maybe focus it on focus on software development,Conversation
It looks like i'm gonna have to give me the rest^ I think you've got this round,Conversation
i'm a quick learner,Conversation
Thirteen,Conversation
Okay awesome,Conversation
Okay play again more,Conversation
One more,Conversation
Oh yeah,Conversation
yeah i'm starting in the fall hopefully i'm planning on getting the masters and I hear you empty^ but from what I was looking at what,Conversation
seemed it seemed narrow enough that it didn't have that same,Conversation
issue that you were talking about,Conversation
Well^ that field is blowing up it's a ton of jobs lots of research opportunities^ depending on what you want to do,Conversation
seems exciting,Conversation
Interesting shape here,Conversation
We almost have like perfect symmetry,Conversation
Ah^ so perfect,Conversation
Like literally one click might do the entire,Conversation
God i'd love to see the,Conversation
algorithm for this computer replaces,Conversation
See you were giving me one,Conversation
i'm giving you one I hope it works out for me,Conversation
Okay,Conversation
That seems to be yeah,Conversation
wow,Conversation
Literally,Conversation
I literally like one this click fills the entire board we played this,Conversation
Okay,Conversation
Okay^ I can't do anything here^ I have to take that,Conversation
I think the rest is yours^ I don't see around this,Conversation
huh,Conversation
hear,Conversation
Anything I feel in a straight,Conversation
Line okay I don't see any way to prevent okay,Conversation
Maybe,Conversation
we'll play a,Conversation
Good game,Conversation
and,Conversation
that's an interesting word,Conversation
yeah that was that was,Conversation
it's all about creating those patterns and hold it into it okay So what do you think is three pretty good^ or should we play a few more,Conversation
I think we got them again got enough for these three right,Conversation
I agree,Conversation
Okay okay,Conversation
awesome so let me^ let me I said I know you recommended a game that i'm not all that familiar with^ so let me look,Conversation
down^ yes^ and then^ if you can explain the,Conversation
You can explain that to me,Conversation
Of course we can we can play that long So here we go right^ you can still see my screen,Conversation
Right yeah again okay okay,Conversation
There we go,Conversation
Alright alright play with friends all right^ let me put this on here we go copy^ let me put it on chat,Conversation
There we go,Conversation
john the game,Conversation
See,Conversation
On in,Conversation
Okay,Conversation
So this is,Conversation
This is this game is called connect for so what you're going to do is every,Instruction
Turn it's,Instruction
Counting down so i'm gonna go ahead^ every turn^ you have to click a column^ and it drops down to the bottom spot I can go,Instruction
So your goal is to connect four dots in a row and we're trying to stop each other from doing it and the main aspect here is that it works^ the graphics you don't get to just choose the spot and the grid,Instruction
Also it drops down through the whole thing,Instruction
yeah and it to the last spot at the barn I can go yeah,Instruction
Okay^ I get it so connect four circles together,Instruction
So the first to do that is the winner,Instruction
and which we kind of go like,Conversation
me directly,Conversation
and go up and down Left and Right and,Conversation
sideways,Conversation
Okay,Conversation
Okay^ I think I understand,Conversation
awesome,Conversation
This,Conversation
What are you getting close there,Conversation
you're almost there,Conversation
i've got three right there,Conversation
Oh okay that makes sense^ OK OK OK,Conversation
OK Hello all right^ that makes sense^ so we all right now I get to try again,Conversation
Now you understand the concept^ a little bit more yeah,Conversation
For sure,Conversation
got,Conversation
It looks like we alternate terms and going first okay,Instruction
Okay^ so I can't allow that during,Conversation
Almost gotcha okay okay,Conversation
Thank you for step ladder,Conversation
I can do vertical to,Conversation
Vertical and diagonal right,Conversation
hmm okay so,Conversation
Let me try the oh die okay so,Conversation
geez okay awesome,Conversation
it's the same concept like you know the game that you,Conversation
Like trying to,Conversation
Make your person to a wrong mess,Conversation
or wrong^ so okay so,Conversation
Okay Okay^ so I go first here all right gotcha,Conversation
see that stepladder effect is really critical,Strategy
That is sneaky sneaky okay,Conversation
All right^ wow you're getting the hang of it^ though you're getting there it's good,Conversation
Okay^ all right^ thank you^ oh it's so much,Conversation
more interesting,Conversation
Can just give me another draw possibly if nobody makes up for,Conversation
Yes^ if we filled the board without anyone connecting forward^ then that would be a draw,Instruction
Okay gotcha,Conversation
No can do that,Conversation
can't get you too many times,Conversation
interesting,Conversation
This thing should have some background music,Conversation
Right and some good like smooth jazz or something,Conversation
Oh so close,Conversation
I didn't even see it,Conversation
Okay^ how about one more heaven I think it's good enough,Conversation
awesome this this game moves a bit faster than the other one,Conversation
Does excellent Okay^ but hey I got better that's been,Conversation
instantly lose yeah yeah you're I could see that you^ you know you're looking at a few steps ahead,Conversation
Oh^ you almost got me there,Conversation
Oh^ I forgot that was over there,Conversation
Okay,Conversation
Nice,Conversation
Good game,Conversation
Good game good game,Conversation
awesome okay,Conversation
All right,Conversation
I think that's the end of screen sharing,Conversation
I think that's all we need to see right,Conversation
yeah I think so,Conversation
let's stop awesome Okay^ no let's look at our instructions,Conversation
We stop the recording,Conversation
um yeah,Conversation
yeah,Conversation
So here let's do this let's take a little 10 minute break once I stopped the recording the online,Conversation
It needs like about 1015 minutes to process the video and put it,Conversation
Up okay oh yeah how about in about 1015 minutes just be back here sounds good or snack or something,Conversation
yeah sounds good,Conversation
Alright C,Conversation
